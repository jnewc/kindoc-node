Under construction
==================

**kindoc** is a documentation tool for the enyo framework. It's in alpha, so is useable but potentially buggy. Currently there's support for kinds, published properties, functions, codeblocks and a couple of other things. I'll compile a full guide for use in the near future. Until then check out the sample folder to see how comments should be structured for use with kindoc.

Usage
-----

Syntax from command line: `node kindoc.js relative/folder/path/to/js-files > docs.html`

Examples
--------

See sample/sample.js for example comment syntax.
